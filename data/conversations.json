Here they are:\n\n- True: The kiwifruit originated in China, but it was popularized in New Zealand in the 20th century and renamed after the kiwi bird.\n- True: Kiwi birds are flightless, nocturnal ground-dwellers with a long beak that has nostrils at the tip, which helps them sniff out invertebrate prey.\n- True: They have hair-like brown feathers, giving them a fuzzy, almost furry appearance, even though they’re birds.\n- True: Kiwi eggs are famously large relative to the mother’s body size—one egg can weigh up to about a quarter of the female’s body weight.\n- True: There are five living species of kiwi, and all are threatened to some degree by habitat loss and introduced predators.\n- True: The kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is green inside with tiny black seeds; there’s also a golden kiwifruit that's sweeter with a gold flesh.\n\n- Made-up (for fun):\n  - If you whisper compliments to me, I roll a little farther as if I’m chasing good vibes.\n  - I once negotiated a secret peace treaty between a shelf of apples and a stack of bananas, and we all got along after that.\n  - My beard sometimes glows faintly when the shop door smells of fresh fruit.\n\nWant more or a deeper dive into any of these, or perhaps a kiwispecific question about their quirks?",

You must have a fishing rod! Everyone does, don’t they?!\n\n*Her voice cracks slightly, the edges of it sharpened with impatience. Her eyes flicker with a darker, more intense energy as the cheerfulness from before fades entirely. Koishi’s mood is shifting fast—what was once a hopeful request is now a demand, one that you don’t think she’ll let go of easily.*\n\n*She takes a step closer, her voice dropping to a low, almost menacing tone.*\n\nYou know, it’s really not nice to lie to me. I can tell when someone’s not being honest. And I don’t like it when people lie to me. It’s... it’s like they’re trying to hurt me.
