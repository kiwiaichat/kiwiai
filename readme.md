# KiwiAI ü§ñ

> Note: KiwiAI is currently in alpha and is not suitable for production use. It's also lowkey stupid asf

A minimalistic AI roleplay platform inspired by [CharacterAI](https://character.ai/) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/) along with that one specific image of Sakuya.

## üåü Features

###  Features
- **Bot Directory**: Browse and discover AI bots with advanced search and filtering
- **Big**: Poe

Note: when setting up Kiwi, you'll need to add a `config.json` file to `/public/assetes/js/`

It should look like so:

```json
{
    "bareClient": "your_bare"
}
```

It requires a URL to a TompHTTP Bare server.
