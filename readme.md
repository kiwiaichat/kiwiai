# KiwiAI 

A minimalistic AI roleplay platform inspired by [CharacterAI](https://character.ai/) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/).

---

Note: when setting up Kiwi, you'll need to add a `config.json` file to `/public/assets/js/`

It should look like so:

```json
{
    "bareClient": "your_bare"
}
```

It requires a URL to a TompHTTP Bare server.
