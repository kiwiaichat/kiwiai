# KiwiAI

A minimalistic AI roleplay platform inspired by [Character.AI](https://character.ai/) and [JanitorAI](https://janitorai.com/).

---

## Setup

When setting up Kiwi, you'll need to create a `config.json` file in the root of the project.

It should look like this:

```json
{
    "webhook": "your_discord_webhook_url",
    "prefix": "your_report_prefix",
    "admins": ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"]
}
```

It requires a URL to a TompHTTP Bare server.

and you must create a `config.json` file in the root of the project.

```json
{
    "webhook": "your_discord_webhook",
    "prefix": "your_prefix"
}
```

in order for reports to be sent to Discord ( for human evaluation ).
